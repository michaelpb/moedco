Tiny Tiny Templates
-------------------

This is a very simple (and tiny) templating system inspired by Django/Jinja
syntax and template philosophy (where templatetags are executed at compile
time, and filters at runtime).

The reason it looks "pre-minified" is because I originally wrote it about 4
years ago (from 2017) inpsired by "coding golf" type challenge to write a micro
templating system, hence the awful code quality. The original version was a few
tweets long.

I might clean it up, but until then it works fairly well and has some basic
unit-tests. The eventual goal is to make it the code so terse that it is easily
comprehendable and extensible / hackable.
